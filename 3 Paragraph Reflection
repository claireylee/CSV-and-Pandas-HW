1. Through this assignment, I was able to gain more insight in working with CSV files through pandas DataFrams
specifically for data manipulation. Specifically, I learned how to load, read, clean, and inspect data using pandas. 
When it came to reading and cleaning datasets, I learned how to clean messy or big datasets. In this assignment I 
was able to work on arranging and correctly implemneting column names or data types as pandas did not interpret the dataset correctly. 
For data maniupulation, I was able to use techniques like filtering based on a given condition, grouping by categorical and quantitative 
vaariables, and also performing aggregations such as summing player statistics. These skills are transferable to future data analysis projects 
where I will be dealing with larger datasets for quick and accurate data exploration/manipulation. 

2. The most challening part of this assignment was dealing with the headers in the CSV file. I had to skip a row for the headers to show up properly
Initially, pandas implemented the column names wrong which lead to a complication of data interpretation. I was able to inspect the file 
and identify the appropriate headers that should have been present. Additionally, handling non-numeric data in columns that contained numeric values was a bit confusing 
as I had to use .to_numeric for data types to be manipulated easily. 

3. The techniques that I used in this assignment, specifically filtering players using metrics and grouping data (schools)
can be extended to a large variety of real-world datasets. For example, these methods can be used in all sports anaytics to compare player performances. 
Additionally, in businesses there can be a lot of application on grouping and filtering when analyzing sales performances 
across departments or locations. This ability to extract and manipulate raw data can be used broadly on many different fields where any sort of data collection is used.
